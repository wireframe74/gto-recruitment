<h3>
Becoming a more successful person has very little to do with aspirations around money or owning things and often has more to do with how well you know and accept yourself. </h3>

<p>It follows that with self-knowledge and acceptance comes growth and opportunity. We are, naturally as human beings, much more inclined to trust people who are authentic and know themselves. The leaders we love and follow are often not dictators but rather people who work to their strengths. In my opinion there are 4 main habits that successful people follow to retain their continued success in life.</p>

<h4>1. They know and accept themselves.</h4>
<p>
They know their strengths and weaknesses. They accept themselves for who they are and work with or around what they are given.
Think of people like Bill Gates or J.K. Rowling. They accept and work with their introverted personalities. They don’t try to be something they aren’t. If they’d spent their lives fighting against their introversion, we likely wouldn’t be enjoying the fruits of their labours today.</p>

<h4>2. They set goals congruent with their personality, values, interests, strengths, skills, mission and purpose.</h4>
<p>Not based on their immediate urges, moods or circumstances.
Martin Luther King Jr., Mother Teresa, Steve Jobs, Nelson Mandela and Oskar Schindler all lived their lives based on who they really were, what they valued, what they were good at and what they realised their mission was. Some of them paid dearly for pursuing their path. But I doubt that any of them would have had it any other way. Friedrich Nietzsche aptly said, “He who has a why to live can bear almost any how.”</p>

              <h4>3. They are in charge of the trajectory of their lives.</h4>
              <p>At the same time, they know that even though they are steering their ship, they can only control themselves. They understand and accept that they can’t control what the world throws in their path, but they can control how they react to those obstacles. They know that they can anticipate and act before the world acts upon them. They know that if they keep pushing forward they will eventually reach their destination.</p>

              
              <h4>4. They accept that they will repeatedly go through tough times.</h4>

              <blockquote>The Dalai Lama wrote, “Pain is inevitable. Suffering is optional.”</blockquote>
              <p>Tough times are par for the course for those who do big things. They know that’s how the world works and don’t fight or complain about it. Without difficult times and failures, there is no learning or growth. </p>
              <p>They know that nothing worth achieving comes without a struggle. 
              Successful people struggle and feel pain, but don’t suffer because they are living their lives and pursuing goals that are in line with who they are, what they value, and what they believe to be their purpose or mission. 
              To them it is worth it.</p>

              <p>If you are not already doing some or all of these things – why not start today? It could change your life and your career. Success is often one great habit away!</p>
